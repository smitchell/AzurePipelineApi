# Azure Pipeline API

This is a nearly out-of-the-box, generate dotnet API application to be deployed to Azure. The "webapi" template was used to generate this project.

```
dotnet new webapi -n AzurePipeline.API
```

It uses the Values Controller from .net core 2.2 because it is simpiler than the Weather Service Controller generated by 3.1.

## Running the app
This application lists for http traffic on port 5000.

```
dotnet run
```

The API can be hit here: [http://localhost:5000/api/values/](http://localhost:5000/api/values/).
